     My poem :<br>
     How i grow you may ask? <br>
        How i survive you may wonder? <br>
        Rose oh Rose how beautiful you may be <br>
         But what you dont know is that everything <br>
   come the deep and sad seas <br>
   Rose oh Rose they may ask? <br>
   Rose oh Rose they may wonder? <br>
   How have you survived these nights<br>
   without letting those pesky bed bugs bite
   
</p>
